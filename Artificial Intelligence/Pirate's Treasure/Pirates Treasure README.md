# Pirate's Treasure Application
This program trains and AI to play the game Pirate's Treasure, a game where two players compete to be the first one to successfully navigate a maze to get the treasure at the end. In this version, the AI is playing alone, but with the goal of finding the most direct route out of the maze. The AI is trained iteratively using a Q-learning algorithm, where the AI uses a balance of random choice and reliance on past experience to make decisions about the next move. In earlier iterations, the AI relies more on random choice to learn what works (or doesn't work) and notes the result in a Q-table. After each iteration, the AI shifts more towards relying on past experience to make decisions until it ultimately finds the best path through the maze.
