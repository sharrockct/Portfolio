# Course Catalog Project
This program takes a list of courses as input, sorts the list using a quick-sort algorithm and stores each course as a node in a Binary Search Tree (BST). Via a menu, the user can then view the sorted class list or view a single course entry. When displaying all courses, the entire BST is traversed with the values stored in each node being printed in turn. When a single course is being displayed, the program traverses the search tree until the correct node is found and then the course is displayed to the screen.
