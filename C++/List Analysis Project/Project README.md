# List Analysis Project
This project integrates C++ and Python to analyze an input list of items and allows a user to see the results in a variety of formats.  The backbone of the program and the menu is coded in C++ while the analysis is performed using Python.  Once the analysis is completed, the results are passed back to the C++ portion of the program for display and to await the next user command.
